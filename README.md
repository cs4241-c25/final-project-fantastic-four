# Description
This application is event management software that allows for the creation of approved guest lists for social events. Users verified by administrators can add and delete names on a list for each event and edit their own account information. Administrators can create events, edit them, and delete users and any names on any list. They can also deactivate events to prevent addition of new names, revoke list access from any user, and change roles of other members to administrator or door duty. In door mode users can check in guests and the time they were checked in is recorded. Due to unforeseen circumstances for one group member door functionality was not completed on time.
